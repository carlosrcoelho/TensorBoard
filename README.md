# TensorBoard
In this part, we will learn about the TensorBoard and how we can use it to visualize and analyze our models. TensorBoard is a visualization toolkit that provides the visualization and tooling needed for machine learning experimentation.

We will learn:
- How to install and use the TensorBoard in Pytorch
- How to add images
- How to add a model graph
- How to visualize loss and accuracy during training
- How to plot precision-recall curves
